/**
 * In-process tool gate for Pi's built-in FS tools.
 *
 * Pi's built-in FS tools (read/write/edit/ls/find/grep) run in-process inside
 * the Pi JS runtime and never spawn a subprocess, so the kernel sandbox layer
 * cannot see them. This module intercepts tool_call events for those tools and
 * enforces the same policy that the subprocess layer applies to bash commands.
 *
 * This is also the authoritative enforcer for denyPatterns on Linux, where
 * Landlock is allow-only and glob-based deny semantics must be handled here.
 *
 * Out of scope: in-process network calls (Pi's own fetch() and HTTP). Those are
 * out of scope for the sandbox layer — the permissions extension is the only
 * enforcement mechanism for in-process HTTP. See the threat model in README.
 *
 * TOCTOU note: Pi may evaluate a path between our check and the real FS
 * operation. This is a known weakness of in-process gates; the kernel layer is
 * authoritative for bash. This is documented rather than worked around.
